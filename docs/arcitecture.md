# Mosaic Technical Architecture

## Foundation

Our application is built on Lovable's carefully selected technology stack, providing a robust foundation for both web deployment and future iOS App Store distribution.

### Core Technologies

Frontend Framework:
- React with Vite foundation
- TypeScript for complete type safety
- Modern ES6+ JavaScript features

UI Components:
- shadcn/ui component library
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Inter font family integration
- Responsive design patterns

State Management:
- Zustand for global state
- React Query for data fetching
- LocalStorage for persistence
- PWA capabilities for offline access

### Component Architecture

1. Exercise Library Components:
```typescript
// Core exercise display components
- ExerciseCard
- ExerciseGrid
- ExerciseList
- ExerciseModal

// Navigation and filtering
- CategoryFilter
- SearchBar
- ViewToggle
```

2. Video Integration:
```typescript
// Video playback system
- VideoPlayer
- VideoModal
- ThumbnailDisplay
- LoadingStates
```

3. State Management Pattern:
```typescript
// Exercise store example
interface ExerciseState {
  exercises: Exercise[];
  selectedExercise: Exercise | null;
  viewMode: 'grid' | 'list';
  filters: ExerciseFilters;
}

// Video playback store
interface VideoState {
  isPlaying: boolean;
  currentTime: number;
  playbackRate: number;
}
```

### Data Flow

1. Data Fetching:
```typescript
// Exercise data fetching
const useExercises = () => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['exercises'],
    queryFn: fetchExercises,
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000
  });
};
```

2. State Updates:
```typescript
// Global state updates
const useExerciseStore = create<ExerciseState>((set) => ({
  exercises: [],
  setExercises: (exercises) => set({ exercises })
}));
```

3. Local State Management:
```typescript
// Component-level state
const [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = useState(false);
```

### Performance Optimization

1. Code Splitting:
```typescript
// Lazy loading components
const ExerciseModal = lazy(() => import('./ExerciseModal'));
```

2. Asset Optimization:
- Image compression and caching
- Video thumbnail management
- Font loading optimization

### iOS Compatibility

1. PWA Implementation:
- Service worker configuration
- Offline data access
- Background sync

2. Capacitor Integration:
- Native iOS wrapping
- App Store preparation
- Certificate management

## Development Workflow

### Version Control
- Feature branch workflow
- Pull request requirements
- Code review process

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for features
- Performance testing
- iOS compatibility testing

### Deployment Process
- Build optimization
- Environment configuration
- Release procedures

## Security Considerations

1. Authentication:
- Token management
- Session handling
- Secure storage

2. Data Protection:
- HTTPS enforcement
- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection

## Monitoring and Analytics

1. Performance Monitoring:
- Load time tracking
- Error reporting
- Usage analytics

2. User Analytics:
- Exercise popularity
- Search patterns
- Video completion rates
