   - **Studio Plan (Future Feature)**: Supports multiple instructor accounts under one plan, offering shared templates and team management capabilities.

3. **Interactive Flow**:

   - After plan selection, users are redirected to the `CreateAccountForm` for account setup.

4. **Responsive Design**:

  - `name`: The name of the plan.
  - `price`: The cost of the plan (e.g., monthly fee).
  - `features`: A list of features included in the plan.
- `onSelect`: A callback function triggered when a user selects a plan. The selected plan object is passed as an argument.

## Example Usage
```javascript
const plans = [
  {
    name: 'Individual',
    price: '$11.99/month',
    features: [
      '1 Premium Account',
      'Cancel Anytime',
      '15 hours/month audiobook access',
    ],
  },
  {
    name: 'Studio',
    price: 'Custom Pricing',
    features: [
      'Multiple Instructor Accounts',
      'Shared Templates',
      'Team Management',
    ],
  },
];

<PlanSelectionForm 
  plans={plans} 
  onSelect={(selectedPlan) => navigateToAccountCreation(selectedPlan)} 
/>
```

## Notes
- The form should integrate with the `CreateAccountForm` and payment authorization flow.
- Design consistency with Mosaic’s overall aesthetic is critical (e.g., typography, color palette).
- For future scalability, consider dynamic pricing configurations for Studio Plans.
