Let me explain how a parent RoutineBuilder component would organize all these Spotify-like features in a clean, modular way:


RoutineBuilder (Parent Component)
│
├── TopSection
│   ├── SaveButton (top right)
│   ├── TimerDisplay (center)
│   └── RoutineName (below timer)
│
├── ActionBar
│   ├── FavoriteButton
│   └── ShareButton
│
├── ExerciseList (Main Content)
│   └── ExerciseItem (For each exercise)
│       ├── SelectBubble (left)
│       ├── DragHandle
│       ├── ExerciseName
│       ├── ToggleSwitch
│       └── TimeInput (right)
│
└── BottomActions
    ├── CopyButton
    ├── PasteButton
    └── DeleteButton
Here's how the parent component would manage everything:

State Management:

// Core states in parent
const [exercises, setExercises] = useState<Exercise[]>([]);
const [selectedExercises, setSelectedExercises] = useState<number[]>([]);
const [clipboard, setClipboard] = useState<Exercise[]>([]);
const [routineName, setRoutineName] = useState('');
const [isFavorite, setIsFavorite] = useState(false);
Data Flow:
Parent passes down data and callbacks to children
Children emit events up to parent
Parent coordinates between components
Feature Organization:
a) Top Section:

SaveButton gets onSave callback
TimerDisplay gets current exercise/time
RoutineName gets name and update function
b) Exercise Management:

DragDropContext wraps list for reordering
Each exercise item gets:
Selection handlers
Toggle state
Time update callbacks
Drag handlers
c) Bottom Actions:

Enabled/disabled based on selection state
Handle clipboard operations
Manage bulk actions
Key Interactions:

// Selection
const handleSelect = (id: number) => {
  setSelectedExercises(prev => [...prev, id]);
}

// Drag and Drop
const handleReorder = (result: DropResult) => {
  // Update exercise order
}

// Clipboard
const handleCopy = () => {
  const copied = exercises.filter((_, i) => selectedExercises.includes(i));
  setClipboard(copied);
}
Infinite Scroll:
Uses intersection observer
Loads more exercises as needed
Maintains smooth performance
The benefits of this organization:

Clear separation of concerns
Predictable data flow
Reusable components
Easy state management
Maintainable code structure
Each child component stays focused on its specific task while the parent:

Coordinates all interactions
Manages shared state
Handles complex operations
Maintains data consistency
Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this organization or show how any particular component would be implemented?
