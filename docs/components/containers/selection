# SelectionContainer

## What It Does
The `SelectionContainer` is a reusable UI wrapper that combines filters and content. It allows users to toggle between different categories (e.g., routines, favorites, shared routines) and view filtered content (e.g., a list of routines or exercises).

## Key Features
1. **Filter Options:**
   - Displayed at the top of the container as clickable buttons or tabs.
   - Filters include categories like:
     - Routines
     - Favorites
     - Shared Routines
     - Routine Blocks (e.g., Core, Legs).

2. **Content Area:**
   - Displays filtered content below the filters.
   - Content is updated dynamically based on the selected filter.
   - Can display lists, grids, or other layouts.

3. **Action Buttons:**
   - **Manual Entry Button:** Allows users to add a custom exercise directly to the Routine Builder.
   - **Send Button:** Allows users to share routines with others.

## Use Cases
1. **Routine Builder:**  
   - Users filter exercises by routine block (Core, Legs, etc.) and select the ones to add.
   - Users can add custom exercises via the "Manual Entry" button.

2. **Saved Routines:**  
   - Users filter routines by categories like "Favorites" or "Shared Routines."
   - Users can share routines via the "Send" button.

3. **Exercise Library:**  
   - Users filter exercises by type (e.g., Light Resistance, Heavy Pulling) to add to routines.
