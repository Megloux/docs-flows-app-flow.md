# ShareModal Component

## Overview
The `ShareModal` facilitates sharing routines within Mosaic. It allows users to select a recipient and share routines via **phone number**, **name**, or **social media handle** (as stored in profiles). The shared routine is added to the recipientâ€™s **"Saved Routines" parent page**.

## Key Features
1. **Recipient Search:**
   - Users can search for recipients by:
     - Phone number.
     - Name.
     - Social media handle.

2. **Recipient Selection:**
   - Displays dynamic search results as the user types.
   - Users can select one recipient from the list.

3. **Confirmation Modal:**
