### **Documentation for `TapToggle` Component**

---

### **Overview**
The `TapToggle` component is a reusable circular button that toggles between two visual states. It is designed to provide intuitive, quick-switch functionality for different app contexts.

This component will initially be used in two primary scenarios:
1. **Exercise Library:**  
   - Toggles between **Grid View** and **List View**.
2. **Routine Builder:**  
   - Toggles between **A (Assisted)** and **R (Resisted)** exercise modes.

Both use cases require smooth animations, clear visual feedback, and easily configurable states.

---

### **Key Features**
1. **Dual Toggle States:**
   - The toggle supports two predefined states:
     - **View Toggle:** Grid vs. List.
     - **Mode Toggle:** Assisted (A) vs. Resisted (R).
  
2. **Interactive Design:**
   - **Visual Feedback:** The toggle scales on tap/click.
   - **Animations:** Smooth transition animations to provide a polished user experience.

3. **Customizability:**  
   - Props can be passed to define:
     - Active and inactive states.
     - Icons or labels for the two modes.
     - Event handlers for analytics or state updates.

---

### **Props**

| Prop         | Type                  | Description                              |
|--------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `activeState`| `string`              | The current active state (`'grid' | 'list'`, `'A' | 'R'`, etc.) |
| `labels`     | `{ A: string, R: string }` | Labels or icons to display for the states.|
| `onToggle`   | `function`            | Callback triggered when the state changes.|
| `persistState` | `boolean`           | If true, the state is saved in `localStorage`. |

---

### **Component Structure**
1. **Wrapper:**  
   - Contains the two toggle options (rendered as buttons).
  
2. **Toggle Buttons:**  
   - Displays either text labels or icons for each state.  
   - Applies dynamic active and inactive styles.

---

### **Styling and CSS**
- **Base Style:** Circular button with animation and border.  
- **Tailwind Utility Classes:**  
```css
w-8 h-8 rounded-full border transition-all duration-150
hover:scale-110 cursor-pointer text-sm uppercase
```
- Active states have distinct colors:  
  - **Grid View Active:** Blue highlight.
  - **Assisted Active:** Emerald green text.  
  - **Resisted Active:** Rose red text.

---

### **Example Usage**

```tsx
<TapToggle 
  activeState="grid"
  labels={{ grid: 'Grid', list: 'List' }}
  onToggle={(newState) => console.log('Toggled to:', newState)}
  persistState={true}
/>
```

This will render a toggle between **Grid** and **List** views, with local storage persistence.

---

### **Use Cases**
1. **Exercise Library:**  
   - Toggle between Grid and List views for exercise browsing.
2. **Routine Builder:**  
   - Toggle between **Assisted (A)** and **Resisted (R)** modes during routine creation.

---

### **Future Enhancements**
- Allow more than two states for additional flexibility.
- Support customizable animations and icon overrides.

---

### **Location**
This component documentation should be placed in **`docs/components/toggles/TapToggle.md`**.

---

### **Commit Message**
"Add TapToggle documentation for toggle functionality in Exercise Library and Routine Builder"
