### Documentation for `TapToggle` Component

---

### **Overview**
The `TapToggle` component is a circular toggle button that switches between two modes:
- **A (Assisted)**
- **R (Resisted)**

This toggle is primarily used in the **Routine Builder** to quickly assign exercises as either assisted or resisted. The toggle includes a brief animation for a smooth user experience.

---

### **Key Features**
1. **Dual States:**
   - Toggles between:
     - **Assisted (A)** â€“ Displayed in **emerald green** text.
     - **Resisted (R)** â€“ Displayed in **rose red** text.

2. **Interactive Design:**
   - Button scales slightly on tap for visual feedback.
   - Includes a brief animation to enhance user experience.

3. **Reusable Styling:**
   - Circular design with a border.
   - Font styling inherited from global CSS (e.g., **Julius Sans One**).

---

### **Props**
This component does not currently accept props but could be extended for customization (e.g., default state, color overrides).

---

### **CSS/Styling**
- **Circular Button:**
  - **Width/Height:** 32px (8 tailwind units).
  - **Border:** Gray (800).
  - **Text Scaling:** Transition with duration 150ms.
- **Text Colors:**
  - Assisted: **Emerald green**.
  - Resisted: **Rose red**.

Example TailwindCSS classes used:
```css
w-8 h-8 rounded-full border border-gray-800
transition-all duration-150 text-sm uppercase
```

---

### **Use Cases**
1. **Routine Builder:**
   - Allows users to toggle exercises between **Assisted** and **Resisted** during creation or editing.

---

### **Future Enhancements**
- Add props for:
  - Default mode (e.g., start as "A" instead of "R").
  - Customizable colors for `A` and `R`.
- Integrate with state management to save the toggle state for each exercise.

---

### **Implementation Example**
```jsx
<TapToggle />
```

This example renders the toggle with its default "A" state. It can be reused across pages without modification.
