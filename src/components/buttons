# Primary Button Component

## Purpose
The Primary Button is a standard button used throughout the Mosaic app. It provides a premium, clean look and feel with consistent hover and active states for interactive elements.

## Visual States
- **Default:** Charcoal background (#111111) with white text
- **Hover:** Slightly lighter charcoal background (#161616) to indicate hover
- **Active/Pressed:** Turquoise glow effect (#40E0D0 with 20% opacity halo) when the button is clicked or pressed
- **Disabled:** Darker gray (#333333) with reduced opacity (60%)

## Usage Examples
- **"CREATE ROUTINE"** button on the home screen
- **"BROWSE TEMPLATES"** button in the template library
- **"SAVE"** button in the routine builder

## Variations
- **Full width:** Used for prominent calls-to-action, e.g., on the home screen
- **Compact:** Used within lists, with smaller padding and text
- **With icon:** Optional icon can accompany the text (e.g., "SAVE" with a save icon)

## Behavior
- **Animation:** Subtle scale animation on press, shrinking to 95% of the original size
- **Transition:** 150ms transition time for hover and active states
- **Haptic feedback:** On press, especially when using on mobile devices

## Technical Notes
- The button inherits the global font styles from `styles.css`.
- Consistent padding and margin values are used to ensure touch targets meet accessibility standards.
- Supports both text-only and icon+text layouts.
